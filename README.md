## Generative Adversarial Networks with multiple discriminators

This repository contains the code (*Jupyter notebook*) and the dataset (*Brain Tumor MRI Dataset*) related to my master's degree final project on **Generative Adversarial Networks with multiple discriminators**.

I implemented the code in Python programming language using specialized machine learning libraries such as **Tensorflow** and **Keras**.

Finally, we performed a quantitative evaluation of the images generated by each model using the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) metric.

The model can be parameterized by changing the values:

*Number of epochs*
n_epochs = 200

*Batch size*
n_batch = 128

*Size of the latent space (100, 10, 50, 500)*
latent_dim = 100

*Number of discriminators*
num_d = 7

Parameter (Mean, Maximum, Minimum, Median)
parameter = "Mean"

**Keywords**: *Generative Adversarial Networks*, *GAN*, *Convolutional Neural Networks*, *CNN*, *Fréchet Inception Distance*, *deep learning*
